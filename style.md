Naming
- Types start with Upper case ```MyClass```
- Functions and variable start with lower case: ```myMethod```
- Constants are all upper case: ```const double PI = 3.14159265358979323```
- Template parameter names use CamelCase: ```InputIterator```
- All other names are snake_case: ```unordered_map```
- Comment blocks should use `//`
- Member variables are prefixed with ```m_```
- function parameters are prefixed with ```t_```

C++ style:
- C++20 is used as coding standard
- Error handling is done through exceptions, but errors should be _exceptional_ and not be thrown around.
